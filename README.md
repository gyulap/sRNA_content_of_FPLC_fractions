# sRNA content of FPLC fractions
Here we provide the scripts that reproduce the results and figures of the paper Dalmadi et al. 2019. These scripts are not meant to be reusable. Download this directory and run the sRNA_analysis.sh script which downloads sRNA-seq reads from the SRA database and process them. The results are placed in the sRNA-seq directory. Most of the figures and tables underwent post-processing in Excel, Powerpoint, or other GUI softwares, therefore the results will not exactly be the same as they appear in the paper.
